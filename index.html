	<div class="intro">Thanks for stopping by! You can call me Tia.  </div>
	<div class="intro">I graduated from Beijing Normal University in 2018, and I am now working as a remote research assistant in different labs in cognitive psychology. I am curious about how people think about the world as well as themselves. My principal interests deal with behavioral data, including reaction time experimentation, game-based assessment, eye-tracking experimentation, and language from nature environment. </div>

	<div class="intro"> One year ago, I encountered research about causal reasoning and inference, and it just attracted me tightly! Although I am just a beginner, I would like to study more in this area in the future, including research questions: </div>

	<ul class="intro">
		<li>How do different world frameworks affect people's certainty about their inference?</li>
		<li>How do people gather and combine various information when doing causal reasoning? </li>
		<li>How does "theory of mind" influence people's responsibility attribution of agents?</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="intro"> At the same time, I have become a fan of the computational approach. I hope to apply it to my future research, and I would like to work on the debates about:</div>

	<ul class="intro">
		<li>Cognition-driven AI or statistics-driven AI, which would be better?</li>
		<li>Should AI have "bias" just as humans?</li>
		<li>What roles does stochastic play in human reasoning?</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="intro">My hobbies change dynamically. Previous I like acoustic guitar, stand-alone games, softball, field trips. But now I am a fan of Japanese comics and sweet food. </div>
