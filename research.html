		How do people use temporal information to make causal structure judgments? A number of studies have investigated the role of time in inferring generative causal structure, while few have examined prevention. Here, we focus on a challenging task in which participants learn the structure of several causal “devices” on the basis of short clips showing the devices’ patterns of activation over time. Each device potentially includes both generative and preventative causal relationships, such that activation of a cause component either produces an activation of its effect (generation) or blocks any activations within a short time window (prevention). We examine judgment patterns through the lens of a normative model which in-corporates actual causal attribution with considerations of prevention. We contrast this with more computationally tractable feature-based heuristics as well as cognitively plausible local-computation approximations. Participants’ performance was substantially above chance in all conditions. The majority of participants’ causal judgments were best fit by a feature-based approximation while a minority was better aligned with the normative-noisy model or local-computation approximations.

		Cognitive reflection refers to the tendency to override a prepotent intuitive response and to engage in further reflection that leads to the correct response. The present study aimed to validate a child-friendly version of the cognitive reflection test, the CRT-D, in China. We administered the CRT-D to 130 adults and 111 school-age children in China and compared performance on the CRT-D to several measures of rational thinking (belief bias syllogisms, base rate sensitivity, denominator neglect, otherside thinking) and normative thinking dispositions (actively open-minded thinking, need for cognition). The CRT-D was a significant predictor of rational thinking and normative thinking dispositions in both children and adults as previously found in the Western culture. Adults’ performance on the CRT-D correlated with their performance on the original CRT, and children’s performance on the CRT-D predicted rational thinking and normative thinking dispositions even after adjusting for age. These results demonstrate that the CRT-D has broad utility and that cognitive reflection, rational thinking, and normative thinking dispositions converge even in a non- Western culture.

	<div class="studyintro">
		<div class="studytxt">
		Self-paced reading paradigm has been popular in psycholinguistic research for several decades. FAB (named from Forward-And-Backward, but also, FABulous), is a dummy’s tool that helps researchers easily design, implement, and analyze their self-paced reading tasks. Its basis on web languages promotes experiment implement and material sharing in this open science era, while its form-based user interface does not require researchers to have any knowledge in programming languages. In addition, FAB has a unique forward-and-backward mode which can acquire the regressive-like behavior that is usually only be recorded by eye-tracking equipment. Try it if you are in psycholinguistics.
		</div>
		<div class="studytxt">
		Wait a minute. FAB also support other experiments, since it can display stimuli (e.g., words, sentences, pictures, icons, mathematical formula, memorized items) and record the reaction time:) Use it to save your time for programming.

		<div class="studytxt">Events that violate the laws of nature are, by definition, impossible, but recent research suggests that people view some violations as “more impossible” than others (Shtulman & Morgan, 2017). When evaluating the difficulty of magic spells, American adults are influenced by causal considerations that should be irrelevant given the spell’s primary causal violation, judging, for instance, that it would be more difficult to levitate a bowling ball than a basketball even though weight should no longer be a consideration if contact is no longer necessary for support. In the present study, we sought to test the generalizability of these effects in a non-Western context—China—where magical events are represented differently in popular fiction and where reasoning styles are often more holistic than analytic. Across several studies, Chinese adults (n = 466) showed the same tendency as American adults to honor implicit causal constraints when evaluating the plausibility of magical events. These findings suggest that graded notions of impossibility are shared across cultures, possibly because they are a byproduct of the interconnectedness of causal knowledge.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">Course selection is an important issue for college students. We investigate how academic performance is related to elective courses’ selection and allocation. We analyze anonymous transcripts from 1681 undergraduates across ten majors and control the influence of grade inflation. Results show that academic performance decreases when the workload increases. However, students with higher academic performance allocated more courses at the early stage of university when the overall workload is already high, and they took fewer elective course choices at the late stage. Students with higher or lower academic performance also differ in elective course choices. We discuss the possibility of taking course selection as a decision-making process with the goal to maximizing the utility for future careers and how psychological factors such as planning and extrinsic motivation could play a role in this process.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">Similarity­-based theories of language processing predicts that the overlapping features (phonological,semantic, and pragmatic) of the to­be­integrated concepts in sentence could cause processing difficulties during online language understanding, particularly when the syntactic structure is complicated. Two noun phrases were embedded in object­relative vs. subject­relative clauses, and pragmatic similarity of the two phrases (similar: two male or two female proper names vs. dissimilar: one male and one female proper names) was further manipulated. Participants read the sentence in a self­paced moving window fashion and answered a comprehension question immediately after reading each sentence. Results revealed that neither similarity, syntax nor their interaction affected online measures of sentence processing, however, offline comprehension showed the predicted pattern that similarity impaired reading comprehension and this effect was exaggerated when syntactic structure was more complex. These results implied that similarity­-based theories of language processing might not apply to online integration of pragmatic information during complex sentence understanding. Further investigation with even more complex syntactic structures is under way to test this speculation.</div>

	<div class="studyintro">

		<div class="studytxt">Research on adults' numerical abilities suggests that number representations are spatially oriented. Dehaene et al. (1993) named such association of numbers with spatial response as the “SNARC (i.e., spatial–numerical association of response codes) effect,” wherein the right side (e.g. right hand) responds faster than left side when shown larger numbers (and vice-versa when shown smaller numbers).</div>
		<div class="studyimg" id="img-snarc"><img class=”studypic“ src="pic/snarc.jpg"></div>
		

		<div class="studytxt">Given that the SNARC effect serves as an automaticity index of cognitive process, we assume that the SNARC effect is influenced by familiarity. That is, compared to the numerical notation we are not familiar with (e.g. English words, Chinese characters), Arabic digits are more likely to trigger SNARC effect. To test this assumption, we introduced an adaptive procedure based on a simple perceptual orientation task that equates the mean reaction time difference between Arabic digits and traditional Chinese number words. Our results suggested that the SNARC effect interacted with notation, showing a SNARC effect for Arabic digits, but not for verbal numbers, challenging the view that notation does not affect numerical processes associated with spatial representations. </div>
		<div class="studyimg" id="img-color"><img class=”studypic“ src="pic/color.jpg"></div>

		<div class="studytxt">The SNARC effect can be generated in a relationship between space and other ordinal sequences––even weak ordinal information. We tested the SNARC effect in a color word sequence: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet (ROY-G-BIV) and found a reliable SNARC-like effect for Chinese color words, suggesting that without access to any quantitative information or exposure to any previous training, ordinal representation can still activate a sense of space. The results also support the inference that weak ordinal information without quantitative magnitude encoded in the long-term memory can activate spatial representation in a comparison task. </div>

		<div class="studytxt">When doing group work, if one teammate always treats you well while another treats you poorly, would you treat them differently? On one hand, it is intuitive to give more benefit to who hold a more positive attitude towards us (reciprocity). On the other hand, equal treatment might benefit the group atmosphere (fairness, indirect reciprocity). </div>

		<div class="studytxt">In this study, I designed a computer game inspired by "The Cyberball Game" (original for priming social rejection), where participants (n=36) played pass-and-catch with three computer players distinct in the frequency of passing ball to the real participant (positive, average, negative). Results showed that participants with lower conscientiousness passed the ball to the positive player more often, while participants with higher conscientiousness passed ball to three other players equally. Their passing behavior had no discernible correlative relationship with other personalities, like extroversion. This study suggests that conscientiousness interferes the decision-making process when there is a conflict of individual and collective benefit.</div>

		<div class="studytxt"> People with lower resilience will hold a mental state of learned helplessness after experiencing uncontrollable situations. Symptoms include response lag, behavior retardation, and cognitive set (Seligman,1972). We embedded these indexes to in a whack-a-mole like game, to assess people's tendency to exhibit learned helplessness. </div>


		<div class="studytxt">In this game, participants (n=46) were asked to choose food to feed dogs in a limited time. Dogs were then giving rewards or punishments randomly (uncontrollable stage) or accordingly (controllable stage). Log files recorded participants' reaction time, feeding times, and food-choosing strategies. Results showed that food-choosing strategy index was correlated with helplessness inclination assessed by traditional scales (validity, r=0.35). Participants with high levels of helplessness inclination explored fewer types of food after encountering uncontrollable situations. This demo experiment provides a framework to assess helplessness stealthily, where experimenters can expect less social desirability despite variables' sensitivity.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">Williams and Bargh (2008) showed in Science that pure physical warmth (or coldness) can increase people's feelings of interpersonal warmth (or coldness), without any awareness on the part of the person. We replicated this study with a new scenario: asking participants (n=42) to measure the weight of a bottle in 30s (with hot or cold water). This cover story is stricter than those in original study because (1) we controlled the time for participants to experience warmth or coldness; and (2) bottle measurement relates to rational system closely, which might inhibit the interpersonal feeling. </div>

Under this circumstance, we still replicated the original results successfully, indicating that this physical-mental warmth transmit is stable and shared with cultures.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">Interestingly, we also found that participants had a poor and biased weight measuring ability. The bottle with water actually weighted 600g, while 46% of them reported a number equal to or under 300g...
