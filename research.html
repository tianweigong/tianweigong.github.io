	<div class="studyintro">
		<div class="studytxt">
		Self-paced reading paradigm was a classical and popular paradigm in psycholinguistic research. I wrote a browser-based toolkit FAB (FABulous, not Forward-And-Backward) for you to run your own self-paced reading task easily. My procedure can enable participants to read both forward and backward, just like an eye-tracking program! I also provided analysis code to automatically generate eye-tracking like indices, such as gazes, rereading time, regression path duration, probability of regression out. You don’t need to have any knowledge of programming, what you need to prepare is just a CSV sheet of your reading material. Try it if you are in psycholinguistics.
		</div>
		<div class="studytxt">
		Wait a minute. FAB also support other experiments, since it can display stimuli (e.g., words, sentences, pictures, icons, mathematical formula, memorized items) and record the reaction time:) Use it to save your time for programming.

		<div class="studytxt">Events that violate the laws of nature are, by definition, impossible, but recent research suggests that people view some violations as “more impossible” than others (Shtulman & Morgan, 2017). When evaluating the difficulty of magic spells, American adults are influenced by causal considerations that should be irrelevant given the spell’s primary causal violation, judging, for instance, that it would be more difficult to levitate a bowling ball than a basketball even though weight should no longer be a consideration if contact is no longer necessary for support. In the present study, we sought to test the generalizability of these effects in a non-Western context—China—where magical events are represented differently in popular fiction and where reasoning styles are often more holistic than analytic. Across several studies, Chinese adults (n = 466) showed the same tendency as American adults to honor implicit causal constraints when evaluating the plausibility of magical events. These findings suggest that graded notions of impossibility are shared across cultures, possibly because they are a byproduct of the interconnectedness of causal knowledge.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">Similarity­-based theories of language processing predicts that the overlapping features (phonological,semantic, and pragmatic) of the to­be­integrated concepts in sentence could cause processing difficulties during online language understanding, particularly when the syntactic structure is complicated. Two noun phrases were embedded in object­relative vs. subject­relative clauses, and pragmatic similarity of the two phrases (similar: two male or two female proper names vs. dissimilar: one male and one female proper names) was further manipulated. Participants read the sentence in a self­paced moving window fashion and answered a comprehension question immediately after reading each sentence. Results revealed that neither similarity, syntax nor their interaction affected online measures of sentence processing, however, offline comprehension showed the predicted pattern that similarity impaired reading comprehension and this effect was exaggerated when syntactic structure was more complex. These results implied that similarity­-based theories of language processing might not apply to online integration of pragmatic information during complex sentence understanding. Further investigation with even more complex syntactic structures is under way to test this speculation.</div>

	<div class="studyintro">

		<div class="studytxt">Research on adults' numerical abilities suggests that number representations are spatially oriented. Dehaene et al. (1993) named such association of numbers with spatial response as the “SNARC (i.e., spatial–numerical association of response codes) effect,” wherein the right side (e.g. right hand) responds faster than left side when shown larger numbers (and vice-versa when shown smaller numbers).</div>
		<div class="studyimg" id="img-snarc"><img class=”studypic“ src="pic/snarc.jpg"></div>
		

		<div class="studytxt">Given that the SNARC effect serves as an automaticity index of cognitive process, we assume that the SNARC effect is influenced by familiarity. That is, compared to the numerical notation we are not familiar with (e.g. English words, Chinese characters), Arabic digits are more likely to trigger SNARC effect. To test this assumption, we introduced an adaptive procedure based on a simple perceptual orientation task that equates the mean reaction time difference between Arabic digits and traditional Chinese number words. Our results suggested that the SNARC effect interacted with notation, showing a SNARC effect for Arabic digits, but not for verbal numbers, challenging the view that notation does not affect numerical processes associated with spatial representations. </div>
		<div class="studyimg" id="img-color"><img class=”studypic“ src="pic/color.jpg"></div>

		<div class="studytxt">The SNARC effect can be generated in a relationship between space and other ordinal sequences––even weak ordinal information. We tested the SNARC effect in a color word sequence: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet (ROY-G-BIV) and found a reliable SNARC-like effect for Chinese color words, suggesting that without access to any quantitative information or exposure to any previous training, ordinal representation can still activate a sense of space. The results also support the inference that weak ordinal information without quantitative magnitude encoded in the long-term memory can activate spatial representation in a comparison task. </div>

		<div class="studytxt">Compared to self-report assessment, behavior features are less interfered by reference-group effect and social desirability. This study utilized transcripts from two thousand undergraduates and found that course selection behavior can well predict students' grade point average under the LASSO algorithm. Having credits required for graduation, students with high GPA tend to sign up more common classes in early university stage and attend more professional classes later, reflecting an exploration/exploitation-like pattern. For students from a special group who do not hold credit requirement, students with high GPA tend to sign up more classes than average students. This study suggests the important role of meta-planning ability and motivation in academic performance for undergraduates.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">When doing group work, if one teammate always treats you well while another treats you poorly, would you treat them differently? On one hand, it is intuitive to give more benefit to who hold a more positive attitude towards us (reciprocity). On the other hand, equal treatment might benefit the group atmosphere (fairness, indirect reciprocity). </div>

		<div class="studytxt">In this study, I designed a computer game inspired by "The Cyberball Game" (original for priming social rejection), where participants (n=36) played pass-and-catch with three computer players distinct in the frequency of passing ball to the real participant (positive, average, negative). Results showed that participants with lower conscientiousness passed the ball to the positive player more often, while participants with higher conscientiousness passed ball to three other players equally. Their passing behavior had no discernible correlative relationship with other personalities, like extroversion. This study suggests that conscientiousness interferes the decision-making process when there is a conflict of individual and collective benefit.</div>

	<div class="studyintro">
		<div class="studyimg" id="img-dog"><img class=”studypic“ src="pic/dog.gif"></div>
		<div class="studytxt"> People with lower resilience will hold a mental state of learned helplessness after experiencing uncontrollable situations. Symptoms include response lag, behavior retardation, and cognitive set (Seligman,1972). We embedded these indexes to in a whack-a-mole like game, to assess people's tendency to exhibit learned helplessness. </div>


		<div class="studytxt">In this game, participants (n=46) were asked to choose food to feed dogs in a limited time. Dogs were then giving rewards or punishments randomly (uncontrollable stage) or accordingly (controllable stage). Log files recorded participants' reaction time, feeding times, and food-choosing strategies. Results showed that food-choosing strategy index was correlated with helplessness inclination assessed by traditional scales (validity, r=0.35). Participants with high levels of helplessness inclination explored fewer types of food after encountering uncontrollable situations. This demo experiment provides a framework to assess helplessness stealthily, where experimenters can expect less social desirability despite variables' sensitivity.</div>

	<div class="studyintro">	
		<div class="studytxt">Williams and Bargh (2008) showed in Science that pure physical warmth (or coldness) can increase people's feelings of interpersonal warmth (or coldness), without any awareness on the part of the person. We replicated this study with a new scenario: asking participants (n=42) to measure the weight of a bottle in 30s (with hot or cold water). This cover story is stricter than those in original study because (1) we controlled the time for participants to experience warmth or coldness; and (2) bottle measurement relates to rational system closely, which might inhibit the interpersonal feeling. </div>

		<div class="studytxt">We also changed the direction of personality rating scales to be counterintuitive (generous, caring-low score; ungenerous, selfish-high score), created incentives for participants to think more rationally and carefully. Under this circumstance, we still replicated the original results successfully, indicating that this physical-mental warmth transmit is stable and shared with cultures.</div>

		<div class="studytxt">Interestingly, we also found that participants had a poor and biased weight measuring ability. The bottle with water actually weighted 600g, while 46% of them reported a number equal to or under 300g...
